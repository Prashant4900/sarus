## Overview

Sarus is a lightweight backend framework for Dart, built on top of Shelf with a modular approach. It provides a simple and efficient way to create web applications and APIs.

When we say `modular`, we mean that Sarus allows you to build your application in a modular way, where each module can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. This makes it easier to manage large applications and promotes code reuse.

## Creating a Project

To create a new Sarus project, you can use the `sarus create` command. This command will generate a new project structure with the necessary files and directories.

```bash
sarus create hello_world
```

This will create a new directory called `hello_world` with the following structure:

```bash title="Hello World"
├── bin
│   └── server.dart
├── lib
│   ├── config
│   │   └── router.dart
│   ├── greeting
│   │   ├── endpoints.dart
│   │   ├── endpoints.g.dart
│   │   └── middlewares.dart
│   └── sarus_application.dart
├── test
│   └── hello_world_test.dart
├── analysis_options.yaml
├── config.yaml
├── .gitignore
├── pubspec.yaml
└── README.md
```

## Running the Project
To run the project, navigate to the project directory and use the `sarus dev` command:

```bash
cd hello_world
sarus dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access your application at [http://localhost:8080/greeting](http://localhost:8080/greeting).

```bash
Loading configuration...
Starting Sarus server...
Server listening on port 8080
```

Make sure it's running by opening your browser and navigating to [http://localhost:8080/greeting](http://localhost:8080/greeting). You should see a response like this:

```json
{
"message": "Hello from GreetingEndpoint"
}
```

## Creating a Module
To create a new module, you can use the `sarus module hello` command. This command will generate a new module structure with the necessary files and directories.

```bash
sarus module hello
```
This will create a new directory called `hello` with the following structure:

```tsx title="Hello Module"
├── endpoints.dart
├── endpoints.g.dart
└── middlewares.dart
```

You can then add your endpoints and middlewares to the `endpoints.dart` and `middlewares.dart` files, respectively.

## Adding an Endpoint
To add an endpoint to your module, you can define a function that returns a `Response` object. For example, in the `endpoints.dart` file of the `hello` module, you can add the following code:

```tsx title="lib/hello/endpoints.dart"
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:hello_world/hello/middlewares.dart';
import 'package:sarus/sarus.dart';

part 'endpoints.g.dart';

@Endpoint(path: '/hello')
class HelloEndpoints extends Endpoints {
  HelloEndpoints() : super();

  @Get()
  Future<Response> index(
    Request request,
    @QueryParam('name') String name,
  ) async {
    return Response.ok(
      jsonEncode({
        'message': 'Hello, World! from $name',
      }),
    );
  }

  @override
  RouterConfig get router => _$helloEndpointsRouterConfig(this);

  @override
  Handler get handler =>
      const Pipeline().addMiddleware(helloMiddleware).addHandler(router.call);
}
```

This code defines an endpoint at `/hello` that responds with a JSON object containing a greeting message. The `@QueryParam` annotation allows you to pass a query parameter called `name` to the endpoint.

Similarly, you can add more endpoints to the `HelloEndpoints` class by defining more methods with the appropriate HTTP method annotations (`@Get()`, `@Post()`, etc.). You can also use the `@PathParam` annotation to extract path parameters from the request URL.

## Adding a Middleware
To add a middleware to your module, you can define a function that takes a `Handler` and returns a `Handler`. For example, in the `middlewares.dart` file of the `hello` module, you can add the following code:

```tsx title="lib/hello/middlewares.dart"
import 'package:sarus/sarus.dart';

Middleware helloMiddleware = createMiddleware(
  requestHandler: (request) {
    print('Hello Request: ${request.method} ${request.requestedUri}');
    return null;
  },
);
```

This code defines a middleware that logs the request method and URL to the console. You can add this middleware to your endpoint by using the `addMiddleware` method on the `Pipeline` class.

## Add the endpoint to the Router
To add the `HelloEndpoints` to the router, you can modify the `router.dart` file in the `config` directory. You can import the `HelloEndpoints` class and add it to the router configuration.

```tsx title="lib/config/router.dart"
import 'package:hello_world/greeting/endpoints.dart';
import 'package:hello_world/hello/endpoints.dart';
import 'package:sarus/sarus.dart';

final router = Router(
  globalMiddleware: [logRequests()],
  routes: [
    Route(
      endpoints: [GreetingEndpoints()],
    ),
    Route(
      endpoints: [HelloEndpoints()],
    ),
  ],
);
```

Note: Each `Route` can have multiple endpoints, and you can add as many routes as you need. The `globalMiddleware` is applied to all routes.

## Running the Project Again
After making these changes, you can run the project again using the `sarus dev` command:

```bash
sarus dev
```

You can now access the new endpoint at [http://localhost:8080/hello?name=YourName](http://localhost:8080/hello?name=YourName). You should see a response like this:

```json
{
  "message": "Hello, World! from YourName"
}
```

## Pass Request Body to Endpoint
To pass a request body to an endpoint, you can use the `@Body` annotation. For example, you can modify the `HelloEndpoints` class to include a new endpoint that accepts a JSON body:

First, we need to create a model class to represent the request body. Create a new file called `models.dart` in the `hello` module:

```tsx title="lib/hello/models.dart"
import 'package:sarus/sarus.dart';

part 'models.g.dart';

@DTO()
class UserModel {
  UserModel({
    required this.firstName,
    required this.lastName,
    this.email,
    this.age,
  });

  factory UserModel.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) =>
      _$UserModelFromJson(json);

  @JsonKey(name: 'first_name', includeIfNull: false)
  final String firstName;
  @JsonKey(name: 'last_name', includeIfNull: false)
  final String lastName;
  final String? email;
  final int? age;

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => _$UserModelToJson(this);
}
```

Note: The `@DTO()` annotation is used to generate the serialization and deserialization code for the model class. The `part` directive is used to include the generated code. Each DTO class must have `fromJson` method to deserialize the JSON data and a `toJson` method to serialize the object back to JSON.

Now, Run the following command to generate the serialization code:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This will generate a file called `models.g.dart` in the same directory as the `models.dart` file.

Next, modify the `HelloEndpoints` class to include a new endpoint that accepts a JSON body:

```tsx title="lib/hello/endpoints.dart"
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:hello_world/hello/middlewares.dart';
import 'package:hello_world/hello/models.dart';
import 'package:sarus/sarus.dart';

part 'endpoints.g.dart';

@Endpoint(path: '/hello')
class HelloEndpoints extends Endpoints {
  HelloEndpoints() : super();

  @Post(path: '/<id>')
  Future<Response> index(
    Request request,
    @QueryParam('name') String name,
    @PathParam('id') String id,
    @Body() UserModel user,
  ) async {
    return Response.ok(
      jsonEncode({
        'message': 'Hello, World! from $name',
        'id': id,
        'user': user.toJson(),
      }),
    );
  }

  @override
  RouterConfig get router => _$helloEndpointsRouterConfig(this);

  @override
  Handler get handler =>
      const Pipeline().addMiddleware(helloMiddleware).addHandler(router.call);
}
```
This code defines a new endpoint at `/hello/<id>` that accepts a POST request with a JSON body. The `@Body()` annotation is used to extract the request body and deserialize it into a `UserModel` object.

Again, you need to run the build runner to generate the necessary code for the `HelloEndpoints` class:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

or you can use the `watch` command to automatically regenerate the code whenever you make changes:

```bash
dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Now, you can test the new endpoint by sending a POST request with a JSON body. You can use a tool like Postman or cURL to send the request. Here's an example using cURL:

```tsx
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/hello/123?name=YourName \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe", "email": "email@example.com", "age": 30}'
```

You should see a response like this:

```json
{
    "message": "Hello, World! from YourName",
    "id": "123",
    "user": {
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "email": "email@example.com",
        "age": 30
    }
}
```

This response includes the `id` from the URL path and the `user` object from the request body. You can modify the `UserModel` class to include any additional fields you need, and Sarus will handle the serialization and deserialization for you.

## Congratulations!
You have successfully created a Sarus project, added a module, created an endpoint, and added a middleware. You can now continue to build your application by adding more modules, endpoints, and middlewares as needed.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to create a Sarus project, run it, create a module, add an endpoint, and add a middleware. Sarus provides a simple and efficient way to build web applications and APIs in Dart, allowing you to focus on your application's logic without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
